# MMML2023
Project for Kaggle's MMML 2023

I plan to collect the data and build the NN from scratch, so this project is done in two parts, web scraping and analysis

Data collection will be written in javascript - will utilize puppeteer to scrape data from the NCAABB website, then write to a SQL database

Analysis and visualization will be done in python

Blogs about my process will be written throughout the process and publisehd on [my personal website](https://ericlumsden.github.io/).
